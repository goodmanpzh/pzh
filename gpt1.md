## 整理-自我介绍

Good morning / afternoon professors,  it is my honor to have this opportunity to introduce myself. 

My name is PanZhihong, 23 years old, and i come from Handan , a city of Hebei province, In 2024, i will graduate from the Northeastern university, and my major is Data Science and Big Data Technology.

Well, generally speaking, I am a very sunny and easy-going person. In my spare time , I like running and playing basketball. Besides, I also like reading books, especially those novel related to the science.

As for my study, i have always been a hard-working student. I have done my academic courses with a 4.0 GPA and received the award of National Inspirational Scholarship. And also, in this process I developed a strong interest in computer science. I still remember the first time when I had my C++ class. It opened a new world to me. Since then, I told myself, I must work hard to be a postgraduate and make a difference in this field.

Meanwhile, I also worked very hard to pass the postgraduate examinations and finally I made it. But I know this is far from enough. So I come here. In my eyes, University of Science and Technology of China has always been my dreaming place. It enjoys a very great reputation in China and even in the world. And it also has the first-class researching resources and professors. And, if possible, I also want to pursue my doctor degree here.

If i were to be admitted into ustc, i would be so proud of myself and embark on an in-depth study of computer science with my best performance.

Thank you for your listening.
